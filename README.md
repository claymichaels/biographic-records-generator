# records-generator
A tool to generate biographical records, for example a sample data for a database.

I created this because I was tired of making up people as test data for a web application. Successfully generated > 1 million records to stress test the application and the database. Aslo used to prepopulate test environments for customer demos.

Source data includes the most common first, middle, and last names, cities, counties (corrected for state), and foriegn countries.SSNs, phone numbers, and passport numbers are all valid.
